# Sentry SaaS uses stock Yandex ClickHouse, but they don't provide images that
# support ARM, which is relevant especially for Apple M1 laptops, Sentry's
# standard developer environment. As a workaround, we use an altinity image
# targeting ARM.
#
# See https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1385#issuecomment-1101824274
#
# Images built on ARM also need to be tagged to use linux/arm64 on Apple
# silicon Macs to work around an issue where they are built for
# linux/amd64 by default due to virtualization.
# See https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/3286 for the Docker bug.
